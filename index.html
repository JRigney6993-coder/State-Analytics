            <p>Our school is one of the best and most esteemed schools in Arizona! While we are somewhat limited on what we
                offer
                from the people that have taken our classes we have accumulated an amazing 1/5 stars! We offer classes mostly
                for
                anyone wanting to perform in a cicus but these skills can be used in other places as well! All of our classes
                are
                the best of qualities and they provide a lot of real life experience and teach valuable lessons in this career.
                Now
                this might sound too good to be true, but we do have one issue, our costs ot get in are quite high and we only
                have
                a 107% accepetance rate.</p>

            <h2 class="title" id="history">History</h2>
            <p>East-Mec was founded in Arizona in 1914 at the start of WWI so that people could have entertainment while
                everyone
                else was at war. It didn't go well and most of the people were made fun of for being cowards that wouldn't fight
                in
                the war. We slowly expanded around the area of Arizona and we are now the biggest circus school in the state of
                Arizona. We are very presltigous and have a beutiful history of successful performers! </p>
